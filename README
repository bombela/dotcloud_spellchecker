A demo project for dotcloud providing a simple spell checking service.

The drastically easy to use tools offered by dotcloud permit this fancy
architecture:

- train.spell.dotcloud.com
  A simple web service to feed the spell checker database for training the probability
  model (a complicated way to say: word counting).

- checker.spell.dotcloud.com
  A simple web service to spell check some text.

- broker.spell.dotcloud.com
  A broker (rabbitmq) as a message passing service, used to route message
  between train and spell checker services to/from the workers.

- worker1.spell.dotcloud.com
- worker2.spell.dotcloud.com
- worker3.spell.dotcloud.com
  Service used as worker to process the spell checking computation as well as
  words counting job.

- monitor.spell.dotcloud.com
  A simple web page to provide some statistic about all the machinery.
